# Livestream Data into Python

The `livestream.py` script demonstrates real-time plotting of data via
Matplotlib. This code is currently designed to work with a very specific piece
of hardware, but the methods implemented here are pretty general.

To visualize the live data stream from your favorite Biomonitor device, run:

```unix
python livestream.py
```
