# Livestream Data into Python

The `livestream.py` script demonstrates real-time plotting of data via
Matplotlib. This code is currently designed to work with a very specific piece
of hardware, but the methods implemented here are pretty general.

Once connected to your favorite Biomonitor device, visualize the live data by
running:

```unix
python livestream.py
```
