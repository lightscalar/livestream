# Livestream Data into Python

The `livestream.py` script demonstrates realtime plotting of data in
Matplotlib. This is currently designed to work with a very specific piece of
hardware, but the methods implemented here are pretty general.

To visualize the livestream, run:

```unix
python livestream.py
```
